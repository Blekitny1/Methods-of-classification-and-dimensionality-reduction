I have done these projects on Methods of classification and dimensionality reduction course during my Mathematics studies. Detailed descriptions of problems and obtained results are written in polish and included in pdf files. 

1. Film rating prediction from Movie Lens ratings dataset
- NumPy
- implementations of NMF and SVD from sklearn
2. Finding DNA motifs on simulated DNA sequences
- NumPy
- self implemented appropriate version of EM algorithm
3. Classification of home devices based on energy consumption data
- implementation of Hidden Markov Models from sklearn
